# Systolic
Master branch of code for host device of my ultra-low-cost ECG - Systolic. 

This program runs on the host device of the ECG. It is made with Python and relies on PyQt for the GUI.

I'm still in the process of making more documentation and tests, so please let me know if you need any clarification on anything in the meantime.
